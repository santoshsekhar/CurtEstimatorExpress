### MVP Phase 3 : 


| ID | User Story | Client Accepted | Comments |
|--|--|--|--|
| 1| [Girish] As an administrator, when copying from an existing estimate, I want to be redirected to the create estimate page with all fields transferred over exactly, except the unique job name, which should be the same, except with a (1) after it to make it unique.<ul>**Validator** : Santosh </ul> | | |
| 2 |[Yashwanth] As an administrator, while creating a new estimate, I want to see the job cost in dollars and $/sqft while I change the entries. (Could we put this in a footer bar so as numbers change, the costs change as the user changes numbers - e.g. watch price change as sqft increases)<ul>**Validator** : Girish | | |
| 3 |[Santosh] Optional: As an administrator, I want my work saved after every modification (please don't make me click save - I might forget and my estimate would be lost).<ul>**Validator** : Yashwanth </ul>| | |
